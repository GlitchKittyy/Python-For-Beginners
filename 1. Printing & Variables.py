# Python For Beginners

# 1. Print & Variables

print("Hello World!")
# Outcome: Hello World!

# You use the print function when you want to print
# things to the console

# Example:

print("Hello, I like food!")
# Outcome: 

# A variable holds a value that can be changed
# To make a variable just give it a name

# Example: Hello, I like food!

name = "John"

# Here I've created a variable with a value of "John"
# In this case the name variable holds a value that is a string
# A string is used for text
# When you make a variable you cant use spaces for the name
# you can use underscores and numbers

# To use variables in a print function add it in the print function

# Example:

print(name)
# Outcome: John

# To add additional text use the '+' to add text or variables in
# the print function

# Example:

print("My name is" + name)
# Outcome: My name isJohn

# In this case you need to add a space in the string that holds
# the first bit of text
# Another way is to use ',' this will automaticly add a space

# Example:

print("My name is", name)
# Outcome: My name is John

# For numbers the variable is either a int or a float
# An int holds full numbers like 1 2 3
# Whilst a float holds numbers with a decimal like 1.0 2.4 3.1

# Example:

number1 = 1

# In this case number1 is a int that holds a value of 1
# For a float you just need to add a . with a number after it

# Example:

number2 = 2.0

# You can change the value of the variables

# Example

number1 = 2

# We changed number1 from 1 to 2

# Try it your self!
#
# ---
#
# Make a variable called name and make it store your own name
# and print the name variable
