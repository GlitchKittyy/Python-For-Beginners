### Who am I?

Hey there! I'm GlitchKittyy, and I'm passionate about making programming accessible and enjoyable for everyone. This repository is my attempt to create a comprehensive learning resource for Python beginners.

### What is this repository about?

This repository is dedicated to helping beginners learn Python programming from scratch. Whether you're a complete novice or someone looking to refresh your Python skills, you'll find resources here to guide you through the basics and beyond.

### Why did I create this repository?

I believe that learning to code should be fun and accessible to all. Python is a fantastic language for beginners due to its readability and versatility.
